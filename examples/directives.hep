/*
STATIC IF:
static if = regular if requires if boday and else body to be compiled, but static doesnt, only the compile time
branch needs to compile, this is only true syntactally not semantically - so that identifiers dont have to exist instances
none evaluating branch but it has to parse
Can also be used in the middle of structs to conditionally add fields
Same with functions
